        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Sree</strong>! A passionate App Developer with a love for merging power systems
            with the IT world. 
            I thrive on solving problems, exploring creative ideas, 
            and bringing concepts to life.</p>

        <p>With a background in Electrical Engineering, I’ve worked on exciting academic projects like 
            <strong>Development of a Solar Charger</strong>, <strong>Designing a smart walking stick</strong>, 
            and <strong>Toys for autistic kids</strong>, honing my skills in Arduino UNO, Sensors and Proteus 8
            . These experiences have shaped my ability to think critically, innovate, and continuously learn.</p>

        <p>Beyond coding and technology, I enjoy listening music. I believe in lifelong learning, collaboration 
            and creativity and my goal is to make a positive impact through my work.</p>
